Start Date: 2025-09-16

## Scope
- Customer-facing storefront integrated with backend APIs
- Admin dashboard for analytics and management
- Auth, cart, orders, returns, coupons flows

## Environment
- API Base URL: set via `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:5000/api`)

## Changelog

2025-09-16
- Created API client `frontend/src/api/client.js` with auth header support and helpers (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) and `setAuthToken`.
- Planned tasks in TODOs for AuthContext, CartContext, customer pages, admin dashboard, and account flows.
- Implemented AuthContext and wired `AuthForm` to `/auth/*` endpoints.
- Implemented CartContext and wired to `/cart/*` endpoints.
- Added product listing (`ProductsList.jsx`) and details (`ProductDetail.jsx`) using `/products` APIs.
- Updated `Cart.jsx` to use backend cart, with quantity updates/remove and checkout navigation.
- Added checkout flow (`Checkout.jsx`) posting to `/orders`.
- Added account dashboard (`Account.jsx`) loading `/users/profile`, `/users/orders`, `/users/returns`.
- Scaffolded admin area with overview (`Admin/Dashboard.jsx`) and sections: Orders, Products, Returns, Coupons, Users.
- Admin actions: update order status/payment, toggle product active and update stock, toggle/create coupons, toggle user active.
- Added return creation page (`Returns/CreateReturn.jsx`) using `/returns`.
- Added category routing, search, featured, and public coupons pages.
- Added order details view and return media upload pages.
- Added address book UI and auth flows (verify/resend/forgot/reset/change).
- Implemented token refresh with auto-retry.
- Added admin analytics, system health, activity log, and export pages.

## Next Up
- Polish UI (styling, pagination, error states), validations, and role-guarded nav links.

## Remaining Enhancements
- Add consistent pagination/sorting/filters across customer and admin lists
- Improve UX: loading skeletons, success/error toasts, client-side validations
- Replace raw analytics JSON with charts (e.g., sales/orders/users/products)
- Export UX: CSV download flow and file naming
- Product images: add uploader and integrate cloud storage (e.g., Cloudinary)
- Payment gateway integration (current flow supports manual/reference)
- SEO: meta tags, sitemap/robots, and friendly 404/500 pages
- Testing: basic e2e for auth/cart/checkout and admin management flows
- Accessibility and Lighthouse performance passes

## Notes
- Backend requires JWT in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. Refresh token flow available at `/auth/refresh`.
- Ensure CORS origin matches frontend URL in backend `.env`.
